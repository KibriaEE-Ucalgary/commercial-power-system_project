#In this project, we have developed the electrical layout for a building situated on a 10-acre site. As part of Milestone 1, we
performed lumen calculations, receptacle placement analysis, load assessment, and panel scheduling for each room based
on the base plan. Following these calculations, we determined the appropriate conduit sizing for both continuous and noncontinuous loads. Using these data points, we proceeded with the lighting design, power distribution layout, and single-line
diagrams (SLD) for both normal and emergency systems. As part of Milestone 2, we rectify the mistake we have done.
Also, as a part of this milestone, we have done summary report with the inclusion of UPS, the inclusion of generator and
their type & size, summary report for renewable energy and zero carbon initiative. Finally, we implemented safety measures
and provided recommendations for this project.
