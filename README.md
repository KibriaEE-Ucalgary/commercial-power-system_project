# ⚡ Multipurpose Building Electrical Design Project

This repository contains the complete electrical design for a multipurpose commercial building, developed as part of the **ENGG 683 – Electrical Design of Buildings** course at the **Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary (Winter 2025)**.

The project was completed in five key milestones, following a progressive design approach in accordance with the Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and industry best practices.

## 🧭 Project Summary

The goal of this project was to create a reliable, cost-effective, and code-compliant electrical design that meets the lighting, power, safety, and sustainability needs of a modern multipurpose building. The design includes:

- **Normal and Emergency Power Distribution**
- **Lighting Layout and Controls**
- **Load Calculations and Panel Scheduling**
- **Arc Flash and Short Circuit Safety Analysis**
- **Renewable Integration (Solar PV)**
- **Smart Design and Future-readiness**
